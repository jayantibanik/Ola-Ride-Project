# OLA Ride Project

A user-friendly Power BI visualisation tool is build to explore the rate of bookings, vehicles are rated depending on different measures and revenue earned.

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of ride bookings for a transportation service during July 2024. It exists to help stakeholders monitor key performance indicators such as booking volume, revenue trends, cancellation reasons, customer behaviour, and payment methods. The dashboard aids in identifying operational issues, customer preferences, and areas of improvement. It supports data-driven decisions to improve ride success rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimise business performance.

# The Dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- Power BI Desktop – Main data visualisation platform used to build the report.
- Power Query Editor – Used for data transformation and cleaning.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create measures and implement conditional logic.
- File Formats – .pbix for development and .pdf for dashboard previews.
